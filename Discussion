[Firearm Checks](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks/blob/master/data/nics-firearm-background-checks.csv)
I have chosen this dataset because I found it interesting to have a detailed dataset of firearm background checks gathered by a government identity, 
the FBI. Gun control in generally has become an important issue both in politics and social life. Therefore, the popularity of the debate on gun reforms 
contributed to my interest in this dataset. Another aspect that I like is the applicability of the data to policy proposals. It covers every state 
in the nation and so it can give us a general understanding of the country. Furthermore, the type of gun was listed on the dataset too, which can explain 
if certain guns follow a different pattern. Overall, I think gun control is a critical issue of the U.S. affecting everyone in some way or another.
